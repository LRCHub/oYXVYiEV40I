It was just one of those days*
Me the joker and the ace of spades
The three of us went our own ways
I had to go and meet daisy chains
When i got there she never came
The wind blew and i was on my own on the train
When I got there she didnt come
It was nothing but the cause of hope boy on his drum
And all the dandilions were blowing in the breeze
We landed by the river with the swan and geese
And all the long hairs were drinking on thier knees
Beside the gang of dudes from the west indies
And all the pixie girls were playing by themselves
Waiting for the poem of the midnight bells
And it was just one of those days
Looking for the angle of the changing ways
And it was just a summer time days
It was me suicide and the spanish jose
The three of us were completely blazed
All of us set on making our ways
And when we got there the party was done
The people had bailed with the rising sun
And when we got there the buzz was gone
So we sat down in the corner and played another song
[Interlude:]
It was just one of those days
Me the joker and the ace of spades
The three of us went our own ways
I had to go and meet daisy
