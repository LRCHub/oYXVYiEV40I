Once there was a girl
Who captivated the world
She drew them in with a voice like money
That girl she had it all
Could make the fairest fall
She drew me in with her lips as gold as honey

If she knew
I long to touch her silken skin each night
And if she knew
I did this all for her
If she knew
I need her by my side to breathe alright
And if she knew

Daisy, Daisy, please don't go
Daisy, Daisy, keep me whole
Let me heal you, let me break you
Then we'll do it again
I just crave you, let me save you
From the man who is your end
I don't want to be alone
So tell me where did I go wrong?
And help me see
The green light in front of me
