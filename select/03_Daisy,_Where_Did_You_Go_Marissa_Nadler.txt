There are days that I feel
Something is really
Next to me on my arms
And inside the room
A cold wind does blow
There are two of us here that i know

Daisy where did you go?
You left first and I didn't know
How to unfold the gatekeepers light
I am stuck here in this plight of woe

I had a sister
And I had a home
With many chairs
And we earned our keep
In the circus deep and deflected all the stares
Daisy nothing could scare you
As you'd enter into the room
So why did they take you first
And leave me too soon?

Daisy where did you go
Daisy where did you go
With my phantom limbs and eerie hymns
There are two of us here that I know
Daisy where did you go
Daisy where did you go
With my phantom limbs and eerier hymns
There are two of us here that I know

Daisy where did you go
Daisy where did you go
With my phantom limbs and eerie hymns
There are two of us here that I know
Daisy where did you go
Daisy where did you go
With my phantom limbs and eerie hymns
There are two of us here that I know
