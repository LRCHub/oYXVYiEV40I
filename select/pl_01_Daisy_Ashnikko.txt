You don't wanna see me bratty
Pet the kitty, call me catty
Make your man call me daddy
He talk too much,
he's too chatty (not cool)
CEO, I'm savvy
Respect a bitch, I'm a maverick
Flexible, so elastic
But don't you dare bend a bitch
backwards
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else
did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting up blood in the sink
I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back,
daisies on your nightstand
Never forget,
I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes,
glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying
I'm no Cinderella,
but I like the shoes
Big glass platforms, bitch,
I'm choosy
Long blue hair, blue as a bruise
Only trust a fella
for some light amusement
I'm no prey, but I am pursued
Pray for me, nana,
on the church's pews
No dickstraction, can confuse me
Whiskey in my hip flask,
nothing fruity
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else
did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting up blood in the sink
I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back,
daisies on your nightstand
Never forget,
I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes,
glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying
I'm crazy but you like that
I bite back,
daisies on your nightstand
Never forget,
I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes,
glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying
I'm terrifying
I'm terrifying
