Clap, clap, clap, clap, all will join in
Tap, tap, tap, tap, simple rhythm
On the drum, develop
Into complex intermingling
Orchestral rhythm, tap

Snap, snap, snap, snap with your fingers
Off beat, on time, make it linger
Enriching the rhythm
Do away with skepticism
Come and join the hymn, tap
Sensing the symbiotic forces

Snap, snap, snap, snap with your fingers
Off beat, on time, make it linger
Enriching the rhythm
Do away with skepticism
Come and join the hymn, tap
Sensing the symbiotic forces
