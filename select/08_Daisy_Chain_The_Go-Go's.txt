Punk rock girls with some noise to make
Hollywood 1978
Babe said, "Lets start something great"
We couldn't wait

Char said, "I've gotta go non-stop
Gonna stay up 'til we hit the top"
Soon the other stiletto would drop
For the sweethearts of pop

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain
Flowers bloom, they fade too soon
What happened to our daisy chain?

At number one not doing so fine
Still having some fun spilling the wine
The rising sun never felt too kind
We were out of our minds

Trying too hard to play the part
KV burned out like a shooting star
Been brought down by a broken heart
We were falling apart

Who knew we were going down
So careless with what we'd found
Making and breaking our daisy chain
Flowers bloom, they fade too soon
What happened to our daisy chain?

The high life was already on the wane
The lines were blurred the pace insane
I gotta save myself from this runaway train
We never even said goodbye sweet Jane
